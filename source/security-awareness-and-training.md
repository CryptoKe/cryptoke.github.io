You may have the best security technology and have it very well configured.
But all that fails if your people are not trained adequately to adopt good security practices.
Social engineers take advantage of poor levels of security awareness to gain
information from your staff.

We will assess your security culture and provide the awareness needed to raise it to an adequate level.
This will involve social engineering assessments where we will attempt to compromise procedural and operational controls to gain unauthorized to your internal networks and/or confidential data.


We will conduct training and security awareness and help you mitigate the risks involved.
