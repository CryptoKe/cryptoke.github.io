### We offer security testing services in the following areas:
***
# application testing
We understand that you want to get your applications to market as quickly as possible.


Security of these applications is often overlooked increasing the risk of loss of
revenue and proprietary technology and information. Most companies lack
the expertise to protect their applications from an alarming increasing high
number of attackers.


We will provide security testing of your applications before they get to market to
identify and mitigate these risks. Our goal is to help you protect your
intellectual property and brand reputation. You can therefore go to
market faster without compromising your applications and information
security.
***
# network testing

Your communication systems and network infrastructure must be configured
securely in order to protect clientsâ€™ information assets and maintain network
integrity and availability.


Specific processes must be in place to ensure that internal networks are not
accessible to unauthorized external parties.


We will test both your wired and wireless networks to ensure your internal
infrastructure is secure from unauthorized access. Additionally we will
investigate the use of proper processes by your staff to protect your network
infrastructure.

# hardware testing

Hardware devices are often overlooked when securing systems.
We will provide testing services of devices such as embedded and
microprocessor systems.

Primary targets for hardware devices are; electronic components that store
data; buses that pass data between components (parallel buses and serial
buses); and input interfaces used for administrative or debugging purposes such as 
serial ports, parallel ports and infrared/optical ports.

Our goal for hardware testing will be to identify vulnerabilities that allow
attackers to attain control of the device and to help you address them.
